# Soccer Scoreboard App

## Overview

I developed a **Soccer Scoreboard App** that reads match results from text files and calculates league standings. The application leverages core Java data structures such as **ArrayList** and **HashSet** to efficiently store and process match data.

## Key Features

- Reads and parses match results from external text files  
- Calculates league standings including points, wins, draws, and losses  
- Utilizes **ArrayList** for ordered storage of team data  
- Uses **HashSet** to manage unique teams and avoid duplicates  
- Displays updated standings based on processed match results  

## Technologies Used

- Java (core libraries)  
- File I/O for reading match data  
- Data structures: ArrayList, HashSet  

## What I Learned

- Efficiently managing and processing data using Java collections  
- Reading and parsing data from external files  
- Implementing logic to calculate sports league standings  
- Organizing code for clarity and maintainability  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK installed (Java Development Kit)  
- Basic knowledge of Java programming  

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:


2. Place your match results text files in the designated input folder.

3. Build and run the Java application.

4. View the calculated league standings output in the console or output file.

## Example Usage

- Input text file format example:

TeamA 2 - 1 TeamB
TeamC 0 - 0 TeamD

- The app reads these results and updates standings accordingly.
